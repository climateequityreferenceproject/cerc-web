rev 50 (2016-10-06)
- in pledge data display and download (display.php) replaced the confusion-causing "calcd_target_Mt_Total" column with a placeholder and clarified name of pledged_reduction column

rev 49 (2016-10-02)
- in display.php, you can now specify (via URL parameter dev=dev) if you want to use the core database of the development calculator, rather than the public version (default)
- credentials for accessing the API of the dev calc added to config.php
- now can add nationally submitted BAUs to the pledge

- FIXED: the calculator API is now called via https

rev 48 (2015-08-27)
- new default method for pledge decomposition applied to download/display.php: source categories included in a pledge will be split according
  to their ratio in the BAU of the target year; non-included sources will be held at absolute Mt BAU levels.
- display.php now supports the 'public' URL parameter to filter based on that value
- display.php, when downloading (dl=1) the pledge table as xls, the filename for the download can now be specified via "filname=" URL parameter

rev 47 (2015-08-17)
- when displaying or exporting (display.php) the pledge db, the pledge is now converted into Mt, and the source break down provided in Mt 
  as per data provided in pledge or default method (BAU composition in pledge year) (all based on downloads from core database)
- display.php now looks better (styled table and floating table header)
- moved common functions for accessing core database via calculator API to api_functions.php
- the (core) database name (for time series and regions lookup) is now stored in a cookie for cross-session re-use
- improved description text for pledge breakdown in entry form
- removed depreciated "link to information" field from entry form and pledge table
- added a caveat_ prefix to all caveat-related UI elements to avoid conflict with equally named non-ceveat UI elements (e.g. "conditional" 
  existed in both scopes)
- times series lookup can now be performed for regions as well as countries
- new "pledge_breakdown_assumptions" caveat field
- dumped current mysql database generation code into pledge.sql

- added CHANGELOG file

- additional JSON array data for caveat field is now entered through the GUI - new caveat fields are added through the "caveat_fields.php" config file
- Afghanistan is no longer pre-selected as country for the entry mask (which had resulted in many accidental fake entries for AFG)
- added jQuery extension for floating table head for pledge table (but didn't get it to work yet)

rev 33 (2015-05-01)
- slightly improved the way new regions are pulled from the calculator (re-use DB ID now passed as cookie instead of hidden form field (=persists after closing the page) and now checks whether re-use DB has gone from API)

rev 32 (2015-05-01)
- New regions are pulled from calculator API and added to pledge DB if they don't exist there yet.
- Also, added display.php which outputs pledge DB in a easy to copy'n'paste format.
