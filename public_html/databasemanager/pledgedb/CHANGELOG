rev 35 (2015-05-08)
- moved help text for special uses of caveat field into separate help file
- disabled Rich Text Editor for caveat field (was messing up with special uses, breaking markup and such)

rev 33 (2015-05-01)
- slightly improved the way new regions are pulled from the calculator (re-use DB ID now passed as cookie instead of hidden form field (=persists after closing the page) and now checks whether re-use DB has gone from API)

rev 32 (2015-05-01)
- New regions are pulled from calculator API and added to pledge DB if they don't exist there yet.
- Also, added display.php which outputs pledge DB in a easy to copy'n'paste format.

[...no CHANGELOG prior to rev 32 (which is when CH took over from EKB)...]
