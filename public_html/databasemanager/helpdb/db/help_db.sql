(35,'lu_emissions','Land-use emissions','<p class=\"Para3\">Emissions from land use and land cover change are net releases of greenhouse gases that result from the management of land.

There are several reasons for this. First, the available data for national land use emissions are partial, inconsistent, and contain well-known inaccuracies, a problem that is only compounded by the various well-known opportunities for accounting mischief. A second reason is that, even with accurate data and accounting, a strict fungibility between fossil carbon and land-based carbon is deeply problematic, in that it falsely equates the scope for labile, limited, and multi-purpose stock of carbon on the land to substitute for the permanent and secure stock of fossil carbon deep underground. Third, the extremely close link between land use and other sustainability and human rights concerns suggests that land must be managed within a substantively different type of regime than the UNFCCC, one that focuses on human rights, food security, indigenous rights, biodiversity, and watershed protection, lest it risk seriously undermining these other objectives. This is not to suggest that action on land-related emissions is unimportant or does not warrant science- and equity-based assessment, but rather to argue that such actions should be placed in their holistic context. We are exploring including LULUCF emissions again in the future, albeit only in the context of establishing responsibility for emissions, as opposed to calculating fair shares of future mitigation in the LULUCF sector.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Para3\">For more information about land-use emissions, see the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry</a>.
