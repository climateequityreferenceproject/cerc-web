// this file is included below the <body> tag
// of the index.php. The idea is that here you 
// would put code that returns html/javascript 
// code that would in turn generate a popup notice
// for users to inform them of news from time to
// time. probably a good idea to have some sort
// of cookie based solution to check whether users
// have seen the pop up lately as to not bother
// them too much.
