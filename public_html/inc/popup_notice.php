<?php

// the code that is returned by the function
// get_popup_code() in is file is echoed below
// the <body> tag of the index.php. The idea is that
// here you would put code that returns html/javascript
// code that would in turn generate a popup notice
// for users to inform them of news from time to
// time. probably a good idea to have some sort
// of cookie based solution to check whether users
// have seen the pop up lately as to not bother
// them too much.


function get_popup_code() { // should return valid html
  $retval = '';
  return $retval;
}
